This program analyzes a dataset on material properties, visualizes correlations, and explores relationships through scatter plots. It employs machine learning models such as LightGBM and TensorFlow to predict material hardness. The code preprocesses data, trains models, and evaluates performance. Additionally, it handles missing dependencies and security warnings. The final output includes visualizations, model predictions, and a submission file, contributing to a comprehensive exploration and prediction pipeline for material hardness in a Kaggle competition.
It employs various machine learning models, including LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost, and TensorFlow, to predict material hardness based on a provided dataset. The code utilizes the pandas library for data manipulation, seaborn and matplotlib for data visualization, and scikit-learn for model selection and evaluation. It incorporates ensemble methods such as VotingRegressor and explores different regressors like HistGradientBoostingRegressor and RandomForestRegressor. The TensorFlow model is customized, incorporating batch normalization and early stopping. The code handles potential security vulnerabilities by addressing version warnings for dependencies. Ultimately, it generates visualizations, predicts hardness, and produces a submission file for a Kaggle competition on material hardness prediction.
It generates visualizations, predicts material hardness, and produces a submission file.
